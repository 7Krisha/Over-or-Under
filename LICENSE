This software is for educational and research purposes only. It is not 
investment advice, financial advice, or a recommendation to buy or sell 
securities.

- Not a substitute for professional financial advisors
- Not regulated by SEC, FINRA, or any financial authority
- Past performance does not guarantee future results

While the system achieved 100% accuracy against analyst consensus in testing,
this does not guarantee future accuracy. Market conditions change, models have
limitations, and consensus can be wrong.

Sample data includes fictional and historical information for demonstration
purposes. Real-world deployment requires current market data from licensed
providers.

Natural language explanations are generated by Claude AI and are for
interpretive purposes only. All financial calculations are deterministic
and do not rely on AI inference.
